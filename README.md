## General info
A simple Python number guessing game from Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python.

![Guess the Number](https://github.com/NathanRomasanta/Python-Guess-the-Number/assets/102335871/a1d1b169-930e-4718-91b6-4f469c9da90e)

## Features
The project starts with a random number between 1 and 100 deciding the number to be guessed within that round. The program now then asks the users for the difficulty and proceeds to take that difficulty setting to determine the number of lives for the player. After setting up the necessary values the program loops until the player guesses the mystery number or if they run out of lives. 

Some key features.
* Difficulty Option
* Lives Counter (5 for Hard, 10 for easy)


## Setup
If you want to play this project for yourself simply download the Python file and open it in your IDE.
